AI Manus is a general-purpose AI Agent system that supports running various tools and operations in a sandbox environment. Now with **Claw** — a deeply integrated [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw) AI assistant that brings one-click deployment, per-user isolated containers, and seamless chat history to the Manus ecosystem.

Enjoy your own agent with AI Manus × Claw!

 * Claw: Integrated [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw) AI assistant with one-click deployment, per-user isolated containers, auto-expiry countdown, and full chat history.
 * Sandbox: Each task is allocated a separate sandbox that runs in a local Docker environment.
 * Task Sessions: Session history is managed through MongoDB/Redis, supporting background tasks.
 * Conversations: Supports stopping and interrupting, file upload and download.
 * Multilingual: Supports both Chinese and English.
 * Authentication: User login and authentication.

## Development Roadmap

 * Tools: Support for Deploy & Expose.

### Overall Design

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69775011-1eb7-452f-adaf-cd6603a4dde5)

**When a user initiates a conversation:**

1. Web sends a request to create an Agent to the Server, which creates a Sandbox through `/var/run/docker.sock` and returns a session ID.
2. The Sandbox is an Ubuntu Docker environment that starts Chrome browser and API services for tools like File/Shell.
3. Web sends user messages to the session ID, and when the Server receives user messages, it forwards them to the PlanAct Agent for processing.
4. During processing, the PlanAct Agent calls relevant tools to complete tasks.
5. All events generated during Agent processing are sent back to Web via SSE.

**When users browse tools:**

- Browser:
    1. The Sandbox's headless browser starts a VNC service through xvfb and x11vnc, and converts VNC to websocket through websockify.
    2. Web's NoVNC component connects to the Sandbox through the Server's Websocket Forward, enabling browser viewing.
- Other tools: Other tools work on similar principles.

## Environment Requirements

This project primarily relies on Docker for development and deployment, requiring a relatively new version of Docker:
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose

Model capability requirements:
- Supports LangChain chat model providers (default `openai`)
- Support for FunctionCall
- Support for Json Format output

Deepseek and GPT models are recommended.

## Deployment Guide

Docker Compose is recommended for deployment:

<!-- docker-compose-example.yml -->
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: simpleyyt/manus-frontend
    ports:
      - "5173:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - manus-network
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8000

  backend:
    image: simpleyyt/manus-backend
    depends_on:
      - sandbox
      - claw
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      #- ./mcp.json:/etc/mcp.json # Mount MCP servers directory
    networks:
      - manus-network
    environment:
      # OpenAI API base URL
      - API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
      # OpenAI API key, replace with your own
      - API_KEY=sk-xxxx
      # LLM model name
      - MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
      # LLM temperature parameter, controls randomness
      #- TEMPERATURE=0.7
      # Maximum tokens for LLM response
      #- MAX_TOKENS=2000
      # More configuration options: https://docs.ai-manus.com/#/configuration

  sandbox:
    image: simpleyyt/manus-sandbox
    command: /bin/sh -c "exit 0"  # prevent sandbox from starting, ensure image is pulled
    restart: "no"
    networks:
      - manus-network

  claw:
    image: simpleyyt/manus-claw
    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c "exit 0"  # prevent claw from starting, ensure image is pulled
    restart: "no"
    networks:
      - manus-network

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:7.0
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db
    restart: unless-stopped
    #ports:
    #  - "27017:27017"
    networks:
      - manus-network

  redis:
    image: redis:7.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - manus-network

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
    name: manus-mongodb-data

networks:
  manus-network:
    name: manus-network
    driver: bridge
```
<!-- /docker-compose-example.yml -->

Save as `docker-compose.yml` file, and run:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

> Note: If you see `sandbox-1 exited with code 0`, this is normal, as it ensures the sandbox image is successfully pulled locally.

Open your browser and visit <http://localhost:5173> to access Manus. For more configuration options, see: https://docs.ai-manus.com/#/en/configuration

## Development Guide

### Project Structure

This project consists of the following sub-projects:

* `frontend`: Manus frontend
* `backend`: Manus backend
* `sandbox`: Manus sandbox
* `claw`: Manus Claw — OpenClaw plugin & container image bridging OpenClaw Gateway with Manus backend
* `mockserver`: Mock LLM server (for development/testing)

### Environment Setup

1. Download the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simpleyyt/ai-manus.git
cd ai-manus
```

2. Copy the configuration file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Modify the configuration file. At minimum set `API_KEY`. See [.env.example](https://github.com/simpleyyt/ai-manus/blob/main/.env.example) or [Configuration](https://docs.ai-manus.com/#/en/configuration) for the full list of options:

```ini
API_KEY=sk-xxxx
API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
```

### Development and Debugging

1. Run in debug mode:
```bash
# Equivalent to docker compose -f docker-compose-development.yaml up
./dev.sh up
```

All services will run in reload mode, and code changes will be automatically reloaded. The exposed ports are as follows:
- 5173: Web frontend port
- 8000: Server API service port
- 8080: Sandbox API service port
- 5900: Sandbox VNC port
- 9222: Sandbox Chrome browser CDP port

> *Note: In Debug mode, only one sandbox will be started globally*

2. When dependencies change (`backend/pyproject.toml` or `frontend/package.json`), clean up and rebuild:
```bash
# Clean up all related resources
./dev.sh down -v

# Rebuild images
./dev.sh build

# Run in debug mode
./dev.sh up
```

### Image Publishing

```bash
export IMAGE_REGISTRY=your-registry-url
export IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Build images
./run build

# Push to the corresponding image repository
./run push
```
